👋 Hi, I'm Dorsa!
🎓 .NET Developer Student | 👨‍💻 Passionate about Backend Development | 💻 Based in Borås, Sweden

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m currently diving deep into the world of .NET backend development and loving every second of it. I'm passionate about clean code, scalable solutions, and building powerful APIs using modern tools.

🚀 Technologies & Tools
💻 Languages
C# 🟩 (My main language)

JavaScript (basic understanding for frontends)

🛠️ Frameworks & Platforms
ASP.NET Core – Web API, MVC

Entity Framework Core – Code-first, migrations, seeding

RESTful API Design – Clean and consistent endpoints

🔧 Dev Tools
Visual Studio 🖥️

Swagger 🌐 (API docs & testing)

Postman 📫 (for manual API testing)

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 🛢️

Git & GitHub – Version control & collaboration

📚 What I'm Learning Right Now
✅ Advanced C# (.NET 7/8)

✅ Building and testing Web APIs

✅ Connecting APIs to SQL databases using EF Core

✅ Using Postman and Swagger to simulate real-world API use

✅ Connecting external APIs (e.g. OpenAI, weather APIs) via HttpClient

🌐 Working With APIs
🔹 What I build:
Full-featured REST APIs

Authentication-ready backend logic (JWT coming soon!)

CRUD endpoints for handling models via EF Core

🔹 How I work:
Design the API structure and routes

Build the logic and DB connection
